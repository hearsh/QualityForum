                        Quality Day</span> on the 2nd Thursday of
                      November (8th Nov 2012) at `Hotel Suba
                      International` at Andheri Mumbai.&nbsp; The
                      function started at 6.30 evening with Registration
                      and went on for about 3 ½ hours, ending with
                      dinner.&nbsp; Basudev Bhattacharya, our Secretary
                      welcomed the Speakers, members and invitees and
                      briefed them about the significance of the World
                      Quality Day.&nbsp; Prakash Bhave, our Chairman
                      introduced the Speakers and conducted the seminar
                      comprising presentation of three speakers.&nbsp;
                      Manoj Karkhanis, our Jt. Secretary proposed a vote

                      Forum members, eminent persons from the Quality
                      profession graced this occasion as invitees.<br>
                      <br>
                      A perspective on ‘<span style="font-weight: bold;">Quality
                        and Competitiveness</span>’ in 3 sectors i.e.
                      Industry, Healthcare and Education was provided on
                      this occasion by the speakers.&nbsp; A brief
                      overview of the talks is given below.<br>
                      <br>
                      1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight:
                        bold;">Dr P. Thavamani, Director - Indian Rubber
                        Manufacturers Research Association (IRMRA)</span>
                      spoke on quality for competitiveness and consumer
                      protection in the Rubber industry.<br>
                      <br>
                      The rubber industry in India contributes Rs 50,000
                      Crores worth of products.&nbsp; It also provides
                      employment to 5,00,000 persons.&nbsp; Since most
                      of the consumption is in transport sector, quality
                      of products has a direct impact on safety of the
                      users.&nbsp; Tyres and tubes have a critical role
                      in vehicle safety.&nbsp; Maruti recalled some
                      50,000 vehicles earlier due to quality problems on
                      components in vehicles.&nbsp; Thus quality has a
                      bearing on the profitability.&nbsp; The case of
                      the "O" Ring failure in Challenger during
                      take-off, leading to the catastrophic failure
                      during descent is well documented. The IRMRA has
                      played an important role in quality improvement by
                      enforcing the quality control order on tyres and
                      tubes.&nbsp; Its efforts have ensured the
                      availability of quality requirement complied tyres
                      and tubes in the Indian market.&nbsp; Dr Thavamani
                      emphasized that being small is not more
                      detrimental in achieving excellence.&nbsp; It
                      actually provides agility to dynamically respond
                      in the market place.<br>
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight:
                        bold;">Dr Nikhil D Datar</span>, a leading
                      Gynecologist of Mumbai and founder of the
                      initiative -`<span style="font-weight: bold;">Patient
                        Safety Alliance</span>` - spoke on how the
                      patient communications can be improved to play a
                      major role in better health care.&nbsp; He
                      elaborated the importance of Doctors adequately
                      informing the patient regarding the treatment
                      procedures prior to obtaining his consent.&nbsp;
                      He showed that audio visual media can be used to
                      efficiently educate the patient and reduce
                      communication gap.&nbsp; He stated that in a
                      Harvard Medical Practices Study the overall
                      proportion of adverse outcomes was found to be
                      about 3.7%&nbsp; and only 1.0% of these could be
                      ascribed to individual doctor`s negligence and
                      rest were due to systemic issues.&nbsp; Thus there
                      is a vast scope to reduce adverse outcomes by
                      systems and communication improvement.&nbsp; The
                      `Patient Safety Alliance’ mooted by UNESCO and
                      initiated by Dr Datar in Mumbai is an important
                      step in this direction. (link- <a

                      3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight:
                        bold;">Ms. Sangeeta Gole</span>, a well known
                      school accreditation trainer and assessor of QCI,
                      spoke on the importance of quality in offering
                      better education in the <span style="font-weight:
                        bold;">School system</span>.<br>
                      She surveyed the current scenario in school
                      education.&nbsp; UNESCO has identified the four
                      pillars of school education as<br>
                      <br>
                      i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; learning to know,<br>
                      ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; learning to do,<br>
                      iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; learning to be<br>
                      iv)&nbsp;&nbsp; learning to live together<br>
                      <br>
                      For a school education to be effective, it has to
                      cater to these four aspects and result into the
                      holistic development of the child.&nbsp; She
                      stressed the need to have a strong HR and also a
                      teaching R&amp;D cell in a school.&nbsp; This will
                      be necessary to keep the teachers trained and
                      abreast on the current pedagogy techniques and
                      curriculum developments.&nbsp; The role played by
                      the Accreditation schemes of QCI in improving the
                      system of school governance was also
                      explained.&nbsp; It was noted that if teaching
                      system is inadequate, the defective product, in
                      this case the students, cannot be recalled to set
                      right the defect unlike an industrial product and
                      a good education system has far reaching benefits
                      for the individual as well as the society.&nbsp;
                      Ms Sangeeta Gole also touched on various aspects
                      in school governance such as different boards,
                      private and aided schools, attitudinal issues of
                      stakeholders, role of RTE etc.&nbsp; She finally
                      made an appeal to all the stake holders to come
                      together and strive in the interest of better
                      education to the children.<br>
                      <br>
                      All the three talks generated tremendous
                      interaction amongst the participants (numbering
                      50) that continued well over dinner.&nbsp; <span

                        expense for the WQD function was met from
