                      In order to sensitize the future citizens of the
                      country on the importance of ‘<span
                        style="font-weight: bold;">quality</span>’, it
                      was decided to organize an <span

                      as part of the WQD celebrations, for the students
                      of various vocational education institutions, viz.
                      Engineering, Management, Medicine and allied
                      subjects, in and around Mumbai on “<span

                        me in the profession I would like to pursue?</span>”&nbsp;


                      It was also felt that participation in
                      competitions such as this would give students an
                      opportunity to judge their ability and suitability
                      for a professional life, apart from giving them
                      confidence in compilation of thoughts and written
                      communication.&nbsp; In order to motivate
                      participation, first prize of Rs. 10,000.00 and a
                      second prize of Rs. 7500.00 were announced.<br>

                      received from six colleges and institutes.&nbsp;
                      While judging, it was found that two entries
                      qualified for the second prize.&nbsp; However,
                      instead of splitting the prize amount, it was
                      decided to award two second prizes each of Rs.
